increasing and technological advancements have reduced biological constraints on individuals, simultaneously increasing anthropogenic factors that negatively affect wildlife [1].", "To reduce these growing impacts on species, a number of conservation tools have been used including the rehabilitation of wildlife [2\u20135].", "Wildlife rehabilitation has been defined as providing temporary care, as necessary, to wild animals with the goal of eventual release back into wild [2].", "Following the success and efficacy of programs aimed at enhancing populations of birds and mammals [6], this approach has become key in the conservation of threatened species, particularly terrestrial animals, and the preservation of biodiversity in both developed and developing countries.", "While rehabilitation needs to consider cultural and economic factors at local and regional levels, it also plays a vital role in increasing awareness of animal welfare issues at various scales [7].", "Indeed, outreach efforts by rehabilitation centers can contribute to public awareness and education on threats, and their mitigation, and promote lasting changes for the benefit of the species they work with [5].", "However, while Wimberger et al.", "[3] note the importance of post-release monitoring to assess the successes and failures of rehabilitation methods and highlight the need for ongoing research into protocols and characteristics to aid in the ability of rehabilitators to predict the survival of animals after they have been released."], ["Sea turtles have a low natural survival probability from egg to maturity.", "No parental care is afforded to hatchlings and, they are continually threatened throughout their life cycle by anthropogenic factors such as pollution and fisheries [8].", "This makes the rehabilitation of individuals that have survived the high initial mortality rates helpful to the contribution of population stability or growth [8], particularly if they can then enter or re-enter the breeding population.", "While many injuries from anthropogenic origins can threaten individual sea turtles, rehabilitation can often save injured animals that would otherwise die; for example, entanglement in discarded monofilament line and fishing nets can cause serious wounds and amputations that can lead to death without treatment [4].", "Furthermore, individual rescue and rehabilitation can be particularly important within small, threatened populations, such as hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata (Linnaeus 1766) in the Arabian Gulf region, which have low contemporary breeding numbers and low genetic variability [9].", "In fact, the north-west Indian Ocean has been highlighted as a \u2018High Risk, High Threat\u2019 Regional Management Unit for hawksbill and olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (Eschscholtz 1829) turtles, as well as an area with critical data shortages [10], making it an ideal location to develop and implement rehabilitation programs."], ["Five of the seven sea turtle species have been documented in the Arabian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the \u2018Gulf\u2019): the hawksbill turtle, olive ridley turtle, green turtle Chelonia mydas (Linnaeus 1758), loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta (Linnaeus 1758), and leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea (Blainville 1816) [5, 6].", "Hawksbill and green turtles nest in the Gulf, while loggerhead, olive ridley, and leatherback turtles are infrequent visitors that breed in the wider Indian Ocean [11].", "The Gulf region has undergone rapid economic growth, involving substantial construction along coastal and offshore regions, underpinned by its massive oil and gas industry and by wealth derived from financial centers [12].", "Ongoing threats to sea turtles in the Gulf include fisheries, urban and industrial development, direct hunting, oil exploration, shipping, and climate change [13].", "Because of their vulnerability to natural physiological stressors in this environment, which is subject to extreme temperature changes on a seasonal basis, as well as these additive anthropogenic threats (boat strike, habitat loss), coupled with the financial resources available, sea turtles in the Gulf have proven to be excellent candidates for incorporating rescue, rehabilitation, and release as a conservation strategy [5]."], ["Limited prior

coast of Spain, six of which had been through extended periods of rehabilitation.", "Compared to 12 wild \u201ccontrol\u201d sea turtles, four of the rehabilitated sea turtles showed anomalies in one or more of the tested behavioural parameters.", "Polovina et al.", "[15] found that the dispersal behaviour of captive-raised loggerheads released off Japan did not differ from wild individuals and Flegra et al.", "[16] found that a rehabilitated sea turtle tagged and released in the Mediterranean frequented known sea turtle foraging or breeding locations.", "Mestre et al.", "[8] tracked three rehabilitated sea turtles, one of which had the front flipper amputated, and found that, prior to release, the amputation had little effect on this individual\u2019s swimming ability.", "After release, the animal was tracked for approximately 24 months and behaved similarly to the non-amputee animals included in the study."], ["Amputee turtles, or turtles requiring amputations after becoming entangled in discarded waste, have increasingly been received by the Dubai Turtle Rehabilitation Project (DTRP).", "The DTRP dataset provides an opportunity to expand knowledge of post-release survival for both amputees and non-amputees and aid rehabilitation projects with future release decisions.", "Our aims were: 1) to assess whether rehabilitated sea turtles survive after release, 2) to compare and contrast the movement characteristics of the different species of sea turtles we tracked, and 3) to examine whether amputees and non-amputees within species behaved

outcomes for the rescued animals, it is important to assess the success of rehabilitation programs [6].", "Sea turtles are amenable to remote tracking through the attachment of satellite tags to their carapaces, and this technique provides the opportunity to assess post-release behavior and survival in the DTRP\u2019s rehabilitated and released sea turtles [5].", "Satellite tracking has provided

["The data collected from this study also contribute to the small body of literature from this region.", "Indeed, rehabilitation projects can give access to individuals of species, sex and life stages that are hard to access in wild populations [5] and therefore provide insight into the behaviour of other life-stages.", "For example, we tracked sub-adult and juvenile individuals, while most other tracking studies focus on mature, post-nesting females [39, 40].", "This bias is because adult females are easy to access when they lay eggs on a beach.", "The same pattern exists for sea turtle studies in the Gulf region.", "Pilcher et al.", "[13] satellite tracked 90 post-nesting hawksbill females in the Gulf, but few tracking data are available for other species and other sexes and life stages.", "The only exceptions were from two studies on rehabilitated sea turtles.", "Rees et al.", "[41] tracked two rehabilitated and one post-nesting female green turtle.", "No clear difference was noted in the behaviour of the rehabilitated and non-rehabilitated sea turtles.", "Robinson et al.", "[5] satellite-tracked eight rehabilitated green turtles, including the longest tracked journey of a green turtle to date (8,283 km), and noted that behaviours appeared normal for all eight individuals.", "Our study adds new insight into sea turtle movement and habitat use in the Gulf area,

non-amputees."]]}, {"section_title": "Discussion|Sea turtle habitat use", "section_text": [["Several areas of important sea turtle habitat within the Gulf were identified through the tracking of four species and varying life-stages.", "The mean tracking duration was similar for loggerhead (161 days) and hawksbill turtles (131 days), but the habitat use varied greatly between the two species.", "The core habitat for hawksbill turtles was in the coastal area between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.", "Some areas within this core habitat were utilised by up to four individual hawksbill turtles.", "Many of the tracked adult female hawksbill turtles also moved to this area after nesting [14], further underlining its importance to the species.", "Tracked rehabilitated green turtles also heavily used this same area [5], which makes it an ideal location for targeted management applications to improve protection for turtles in the UAE.", "This area is made up of coral reefs and seagrass beds which are ideal feeding grounds for these two species [23]."], ["Loggerhead turtles had a much larger home range than hawksbill turtles, with individuals moving as far as Iraq and into the Gulf of Oman.", "The main area of overlap among tracked individuals was in the central Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "Their farther dispersal may be a function of their feeding ecology.", "Hawksbill and green turtles rely on seagrass and coral habitat to feed, while loggerhead turtles feed on a wider variety of prey, enabling them to move into other habitats as well.", "Furthermore, the relatively larger home range was likely because loggerhead turtles, unlike hawksbill turtles, are thought to transit through rather than breed in the Gulf.", "Nearby, however, large populations of nesting loggerhead turtles exist on the Indian Ocean coastline of Oman [42].", "Only two of the eleven tracked loggerhead turtles moved out of the Gulf, but neither moved to the known nesting areas, instead forming core habitat close to the UAE/Oman border.", "The fact that most loggerhead turtles, including adult females, did not exit the Gulf may indicate that they forage widely for extended periods within the Gulf.", "Alternatively, it is also possible that they nest within the Gulf, and the area around Shatt Al Arab in particular may be of interest for future research."]]}, {"section_title":

can successfully survive in the wild following extensive periods of rehabilitation.", "The relatively high level of mortality post-release is thought to be related to human threats within the Gulf, rather than to the sea turtles\u2019 previous injuries or the rehabilitation process.", "Godley et al.", "[39], questioned the normality of post-rehabilitated sea turtles\u2019 behaviour, and therefore their suitability for inclusion in satellite tracking and behavioural studies.", "This study does provide some support for rehabilitated sea turtles, even those who have undergone long periods of care and/or with serious injuries such as amputations, as potentially valid candidates for inclusion in behavioural analyses.", "This study also supports the suitability for release of sea turtles that have suffered major injuries, such as amputations, back into the wild.", "This is particularly relevant to life-stages such as male sea turtles and juveniles, which have rarely been included in movement analyses.", "Rehabilitated sea turtles displayed normal behaviours and returned to known and some potentially new foraging habitats.", "We could not test whether the rehabilitated adult sea turtles resumed breeding, due to a lack of long-term tag attachment.", "Investigating their return to nesting beaches would be a logical next step for sea turtle rehabilitation tracking studies."], ["As human populations grow, the number of sea turtles being injured or becoming sick due to anthropogenic reasons will likely also increase.", "Where possible, the implementation of rehabilitation projects can provide a valuable counterbalance for enhancing the welfare of individual sea turtles, and potentially help to mitigate population declines.", "The successful wild survival of the majority of sea turtles tracked here is an encouraging result for the conservation of this threatened group."]]}, {"section_title": "Supporting information|S1 Fig", "section_text": [["(a)
